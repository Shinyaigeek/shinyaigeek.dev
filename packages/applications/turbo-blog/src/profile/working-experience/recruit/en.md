I revamped the UI of an internal frontend application. Recognizing that the complex functionality led to a "power-user-only" UI, I gathered user feedback to identify pain points. My solution simplified the UI while introducing a UNIX-like directory structure for a more familiar and improved user experience. Additionally, I researched web and frontend trends, reporting on their potential impact on our internal products.
