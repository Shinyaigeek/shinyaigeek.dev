As a Product Engineer, I was involved in web development for peripheral products of Nikkei Digital. While developing frontend and BFF layers, I also contributed to technical infrastructure improvements, such as introducing mechanisms to mechanically enforce codebase constraints aligned with business domains and improving build speed of component catalogs.

Later, as a Platform Engineer, I worked on developing and improving the technical infrastructure of Nikkei Digital Web, solving technical challenges in product development and enabling peripheral web product development.

- Led the Next.js migration of applications with legacy and unmaintainable technical infrastructure
  - Achieved gradual migration by refreshing at the infrastructure level, preventing migration-related incidents
  - Realized speedy development through migration to modern technical infrastructure, along with user experience improvements through specification reviews
  - Led design and development with thick mechanical constraints to eliminate development dependencies
- Consolidated common data hardcoded across nearly 20 microservices into a single API, reducing deployment frequency
- Led the monorepo integration of nearly 20 poly-repositories that were essentially the same product with many shared processes
- Improved authorization processing in Nikkei Digital to maintain service availability during ID infrastructure failures
- Improved Nikkei Digital's build infrastructure, achieving nearly 35% improvement
- Established a foundation for static testing in Nikkei Digital's CDN infrastructure

And more.
