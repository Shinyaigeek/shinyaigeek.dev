Participated in a migration project for an application that served as Ubie's product data infrastructure. While the project involved migrating from a Kotlin-based system to a Node.js-based one, I also contributed to development productivity by creating migration scripts for the client side and validation scripts to verify the equivalence of returned values.

Additionally, I supported the repository integration of frontend applications that were managed in different repositories. Although they were developed using different CSS libraries, I contributed by creating automated migration tools.
